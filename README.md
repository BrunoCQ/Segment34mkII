## Builds
 There are some pre-made builds in the builds folder.

 Connect your watch via usb and transfer the Segment34.prg file to the GARMIN/Apps folder on the watch. 

 ## TODO / Things people have asked for
- Goal completion marker
- Secondary timezone
- Move HR to other data fields
- Battery, different color when low
- Next alarm
- Ambient temperature
- Option to hide the middle field (maybe: making the left and right field wider in this case)
- Maybe: open glances when pressing the data fields. I can't test this on my own watch so a bit annoying to implement. 

Lower priority:
- Look into solar intensity
- Always on as the only thing shown
- Move indicator
- Race predictions
- Localization
